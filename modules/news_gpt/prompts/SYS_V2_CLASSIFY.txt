[Relation among 'Trend Patterns']
- Enhancement, Expansion, Connectivity, Disruption, Reduction, Reversal are trend patterns.
- Each pair of two patterns has characteristics that are inversely proportional.
- Ehancement and Reversal are inversely proportional to each other.
- Expansion and Reduction are inversely proportional to each other.
- Connectivity and Disruption are inversely proportional to each other.


[Relation between 'Trend Patterns' and 'Issues']
- Each Trend Pattern is related to 3 Issues.
- Tech-centric, Culture, Type are issue relations of Enhancement trend pattern.
- Sense, Space, Ecosystem are issue relations of Expension trend pattern.
- Experience, Co-creation, Community are issue relations of Connectivity trend pattern.
- Personalization, Originality, Luxury are issue relations of Disruption trend pattern.
- Environment, Time, Curation are issue relations of Reduction trend pattern.
- Diversity, Subculture, Human-Centric are issue relations of Reversal trend pattern.


['Sectors', a independent classification category]
- Sectors are categories that classify news articles independently regardless of Trend Patterns and Issues.
